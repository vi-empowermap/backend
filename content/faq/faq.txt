    The Panel offers a wide range of field
    types that you can use to structure your
    content in the best possible way. From a
    simple text field over multiselect
    fields for users, files or pages to the
    structure field for multiple entries
    like addresses or events, you can
    already do a whole lot. And if that is
    not enough, you can create any custom
    field you need. The possibilities are
    endless.
